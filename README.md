# ermahgerd_eberks_site

site to show which items in the digital minuteman library catalog match your goodreads list

... but really this is just a TODO list so far


## TODO

### v1

* goodreads oauth
* [scrape user's shelves](https://www.goodreads.com/api#reviews.list)
* compare against database from [ermahgerd_eberks](https://github.com/semanticart/ermahgerd_eberks)
* show available books w/ links to library page & format icons


### Someday
* update ermahgerd_eberks to have cover urls. use those.
* recommendation unread books based on authors you liked on your read shelf.
